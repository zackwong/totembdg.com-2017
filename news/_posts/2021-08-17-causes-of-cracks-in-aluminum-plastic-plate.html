<p>The occurrence of cracks in the product manufacturing of aluminum-plastic plate manufacturers will affect the use of ten powders. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the causes of cracks. Therefore, cracks can be better handled to prevent the impact on the use of aluminum-plastic plate.</p>
<p>In other words, if the temperature is too high in winter, cracks may appear in the aluminum-plastic plate. When the aluminum extrusion speed is too fast, the steel cracking caused by the additional tensile stress applied on the metal surface is a common reason, and the metal surface plays the role of additional tensile stress due to friction. In other words, when the additional tensile stress is greater than the tensile strength of the surface metal, cracks will occur, and this kind of fuel rarely occurs.</p>
<p>For aluminum-plastic plate, it is to occupy its own position in the market. A very important point is that it has high strength and strong impact resistance. Ten powder has good plasticity and is easy to use in various scenarios. It can well stop reprocessing. Manufacturers will pay attention to it when consuming aluminum-plastic plates. At present, aluminum-plastic plate has many achievements and difficulties, but it still can not hide its advantages. It has not been loved by all parties for a long time. It is one of the irreplaceable curtain wall products.</p>
